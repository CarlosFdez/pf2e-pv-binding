# PF2E Perfect Vision Binding

Do **not** use with Rules Based Vision (enabled by default in the Pathfinder 2e system).

Automatically updates placed token settings (dimSight/brightSight) based on character senses data (in other words, if the character has darkvision, the token will have 1000 feet brightsight). This is similar to Rules Based Vision, but has nicer light blending for more complex scenes.

It does not work for NPCs, and it only works for placed tokens.

When Foundry 0.9 does adaptive lighting, this module will likely be retired.
