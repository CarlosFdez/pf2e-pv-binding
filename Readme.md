# PF2E Perfect Vision Binding
![Foundry Core Compatible Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCarlosFdez%2Fpf2e-pv-binding%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fmodule.json&label=Foundry%20Version&query=$.compatibleCoreVersion&colorB=orange)

For when you want (most of) the convenience of core PF2e's "rules based vision" automation option with the prettiness of Perfect Vision. Auto updates bright vision, low light vision, and fetchling's special color darkvision in the token options for every actor on the scene, based on the senses traits on the actor. Uses the same methods as the built in rules based automation, so it only supports what it supports (so characters only for now).

If Rules Based Vision + Perfect Vision together is working fine with no issues, then all this does is automate fletching (not very necessary). Light blending for bright torch animations on low light vision actors does look a bit better without rules based vision currently though, so this has a use in that scenario.

When Foundry 0.9 does adaptive lighting, this module will likely be retired.
